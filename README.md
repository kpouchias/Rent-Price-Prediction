# Rent Price Prediction in Thessaloniki Greece
In this project I tried to predict the rent price of an apartment located in Thessaloniki Greece, as well as determine which is the best model I can use for that purpose.

**This repository contains two files with code.**

## 1. Webscraping
I created a Python script in VS Code, to help me aqcuire the Data from a real estate page, and then I saved them as a csv file. The attributes Î™ recorded for its house were the following:
1. **Type**(apartment, detached house, maisonette, building)
2. **Floor Number**
3. **Location**
4. **Year of construction**
5. **Number of bedrooms**
6. **Number of bathrooms**
7. **Price per square meter**
8. **Renting Price**

## 2. Rent_Price_Prediction
The notebook is divided into five sections:
1. **Importing the data to a dataframe using Pandas**
2. **Data Wrangling**
3. **Exporatory Data Analysis**
4. **One-hot Encoding and Feature Engineering**
5. **Model Development and Evaluation**
