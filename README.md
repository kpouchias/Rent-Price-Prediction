# Rent Price Prediction in Thessaloniki Greece
In this project I tried to predict the rent price of an apartment located in Thessaloniki Greece, as well as the best model I can use for that purpose.

## Webscrape.
I created a Python script in VS Code, to help me aqcuire the Data from a real estate page, and then I saved them as a csv file. The attributes Î™ recorded for its house were the following:
1)**Type**(apartment, detached house, maisonette, building)
2)**Floor Number**
3)**Location**
4)**Year of construction**
5)**Number of bedrooms**
6)**Number of bathrooms**
7)**Price per square meter**
8)**Renting Price

## Model
After I saved the data to a csv file, I imported them to a jupyter notebook as a Dataframe, using the Pandas library.
